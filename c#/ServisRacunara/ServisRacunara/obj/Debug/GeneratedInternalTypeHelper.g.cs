<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Commercial distributors of software may
accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners
and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial
product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the
Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial
Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and
costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other
legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to
the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor
to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and
any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate
in any such claim at its own expense.</span> </p>
