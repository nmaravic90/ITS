     - Plug-in and Fragment directories\n\
       - Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs\n\
       - Sub-directories of the directory named "src" of certain Plug-ins\n\
       - Feature directories\n\
\n\
Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is installed using the\n\
Provisioning Technology (as defined below), you must agree to a license ("Feature \n\
Update License") during the installation process. If the Feature contains\n\
Included Features, the Feature Update License should either provide you\n\
with the terms and conditions governing the Included Features or inform\n\
you where you can locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be found in\n\
the "license" property of files named "feature.properties" found within a Feature.\n\
Such Abouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the\n\
terms and conditions (or references to such terms and conditions) that\n\
govern your use of the associated Content in that directory.\n\
\n\
THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY REFER\n\
TO THE EPL OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\
